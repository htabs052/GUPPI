Overview of the Project
=========================
Our project is to create a piece of hardware that will clean the ocean of plastics, 
helping ecosystems and wildlife recover from the massive amounts of pollution it has
seen over the last 100 years.

Github Information
==================
Github Repository: htabs052.github.io


Our Company
========================
Our company and product is called the GUPPI. This is an acronym stands for the 'Global
Underwater Plastic Prevention Iniative'. Our company logo is the Guppi fish, this fish 
is very populous and comes in many different varieties and colours. We think this is an
ideal logo as it symbolizes our goal to have diverse and healthy ecosystems.

Look and Feel of the Website
==========================
When we picture our website we want it to feel natural and smooth, reflecting our company's 
goal for a clean, healthy envrinonment.

	Colours...
	Colours that are generally found in nature: greens, blues, and whites.These colours 
	will all be flat as to allow the user to feel calm as one might in nature (once again 
	reiterating,natural colours) 
	Ex. 	(#78BD7D, #405674, #D0FSBD, #BBE1F4, #8ED687)
	Or	(#BFE4FF, #AEDFE8, #CDFFF9, #AEE8D1, #BFFFD3)

	Buttons and Borders...	
	The borders and buttons will be rounded in order to have everything feel smooth, 
	as if everything blends together well. Buttons will be a solid colour in order to 
	stand out (especially the DONATE button). When a user hover's over a button it will
	grow. 

	Pages...
	Our website will have buttons to redirect the user to the other pages below:
	About/Donation/Team/Technology/Map Colour Based on Country Participation
	These buttons will be centrally located below the title of the page. 

	Images...
	The background of the website will be a large clear image of the ocean (possibly a reef).
	An animated video would be most desirable. Also images of polluted oceans in contrast to a clean
	ocean to really drive the reality of the consequences of pollution home.

	Typography...
	Although a specific font has not been decided on, we want the font to look proffesional, and be
	relatively geometric.
